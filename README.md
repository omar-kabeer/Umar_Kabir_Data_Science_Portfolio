# Umar Kabir Portfolio
## Introduction
Welcome to my data science portfolio website! I'm excited to share with you my projects, skills, and experience.  

As a data scientist, I've worked on a wide range of projects across industries, from healthcare to finance to e-commerce. Each project has presented its own unique challenges and opportunities, and I've learned something new from each one.  

On this website, you'll find examples of my data science projects, including detailed explanations of the problem statement, data analysis, and modeling techniques used. You'll also see visualizations and insights that I've derived from the data, as well as code snippets and notebooks that showcase my technical skills.  

In addition, you can learn more about my background and experience in data science, including my education, certifications, and previous work experience. You can also find information about my skills in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, as well as machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and other technologies.  

Whether you're a recruiter looking for a data scientist to join your team or a fellow data scientist interested in collaborating on a project, I hope that my portfolio website will give you a sense of my expertise and passion for data science.  

So take a look around, explore my projects and skills, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.

### Competition Projects
> **Data Centric AI Competition 2023**: Cleanlab and MachineHack have announced the all new Data-Centric AI Competition 2023. The competition consists of two separate contests, with one dealing with text data and the other dealing with image data.  
The primary objective of this Data-centric AI (DCAI) competition is to predict the correct class associated with each datapoint in a test set using a machine learning classifier trained on a training dataset. The training data presented in these competitions have real world errors and outliers. Participants are thus challenged to take a data-centric approach to solving the problem while leveraging open source tools like cleanlab and many others available.
