# Umar Kabir Portfolio
## Introduction
Welcome to my data science portfolio repository! This repository contains a collection of projects and code samples that showcase my skills and experience in the field of data science. As a data scientist, I have worked on a variety of projects that involve data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. In this repository, you will find examples of my work that demonstrate my proficiency in these areas. Each project and code sample includes a description of the problem being solved, the data used, and the methodology employed. I hope that this portfolio will give you a sense of my skills and experience in data science, and I look forward to hearing from you if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.

### Competition Projects
> **Data Centric AI Competition 2023**: Cleanlab and MachineHack have announced the all new Data-Centric AI Competition 2023. The competition consists of two separate contests, with one dealing with text data and the other dealing with image data.  
The primary objective of this Data-centric AI (DCAI) competition is to predict the correct class associated with each datapoint in a test set using a machine learning classifier trained on a training dataset. The training data presented in these competitions have real world errors and outliers. Participants are thus challenged to take a data-centric approach to solving the problem while leveraging open source tools like cleanlab and many others available.
